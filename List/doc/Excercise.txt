b. modify programm a as given. suppose you have list of seven elements 
e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
remove third element from the lst.the first element to be removed 
would be 3 , leaving the list 
1 2 4 5 6 7
the next element to be remove would be 6 leaving the list
1 2 4 5 7
its a continous cycle so when we reach end of the list, we continue
to count at beginning . next element to be removed is number 2 leaving
the list as
1 4 5 7
next element to be remove is 7
1 4 5
